# [Freesound General-Purpose Audio Tagging Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging/overview) starter pack

Kaggle competitions are probably the best venue for learning how to solve a specific machine learning problem. In this repository we will explore various ways of approaching audio classification.

This repository contains everything you need to get started with the [Freesound General-Purpose Audio Tagging Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging/overview). The dataset is both interesting and challenging. [General audio tagging with ensembling convolutional neural network and statistical features](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12832) features a good overview of the competition.

The notebooks cover downloading and preprocessing of data, building and training models, creating a submission and submitting to Kaggle (late submissions are still open at the time of writing - this is a very useful tool to receive feedback on the performance of your model).
